---------------------------------------

The experiment:

	This is a version of the reinforcement learning task described in Behrens et al, 2007. Participant tacks reward rate associated with each of the two options based on the feedback they receive on a trial by trial basis. 
The experiment randomly runs one of two versions of the task. In one version, feedback delivery is accompanied by celebratory sounds. The other version has no sensory feedback.
