"INSTRUCTIONS
We would now like you to say out loud all the words that you can think of that begin with a letter of the alphabet. We will show you an example with the letter ""Z"", but you could be asked to say words starting with other letters. You cannot say names of people (""Zelda""), places (""Zurich""), or numbers (""zero""). Similar words with different endings (""zoo"" and ""zoos"") will only count as 1 response. Compound words (""zookeeper"") are acceptable.

After you press the ARROW button, you will be given a letter and you can begin speaking once the green, flashing microphone appears. The practice will last for 1 minute, and you should keep trying to think of new words during that time. You cannot use external sources to come up with words. Your time is up when the microphone turns red and stops flashing.
